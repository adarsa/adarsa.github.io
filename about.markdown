I am a Data Science consultant working on open-source platform [Project Sunbird](http://docs.sunbird.org/). I lead a team in developing Machine Learning solutions for the platform with a focus on *Natural Language Processing*. I also work on Data Analytics projects for [Diksha](https://diksha.gov.in/).


When not building data products, I likes to delve into linguistics, travel and paint.<br/>
