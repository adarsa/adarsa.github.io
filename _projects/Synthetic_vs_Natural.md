The research focused on understanding different synthetic speech production techniques and developing signal processing based features for distinction of synthetic and natural speech.

The improvement in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis poses the problem of biometric attack on *speaker verification systems(SVS)*. In this context, the study analyses the performance of TTS systems using false acceptance rate to impostor using artificial speech.  
The research identifies different features for distinction of natural and synthetic speech. Three specific *naturalness* components are identified considering prosody, nonlinearity. Further method of integrating these into GMM-UBM system is proposed.
