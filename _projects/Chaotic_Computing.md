A thesis aimed at understanding the dynamic evolution of a *single chaotic element* and use it for the implementation of basic logic operations. Implemented basic computing functions and modulo arithmetic using the chaotic elements.

The research aimed at implementing fundamental computing functions
using *chaotic elements*. This would provide a theoretical foundation of computer architecture based on a new principle other than silicon chips. The fundamental functions explored are the logical AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and NAND operations (gates) and modulo arithmetic operation. The chaotic elements employed in the implementation were logistic map (nonlinear), tent map (symmetric piecewise linear), and a newly proposed modified piecewise linear map.
